# EDA-on-Brazilian-E-Commerce-Public-Dataset
An Exploratory Data Analysis on the existing public dataset on a Brazilian E-Commerce website. This is made as part of the Data Science Essentials class that I took under Forward School.

> Disclaimer:
> 1. You may pull / download the code and run it directly within Google Collab, but do ensure that the you have Plotly and JupyterDash setup in your colab.
> 2. The dataset is available in Kaggle ([Click here to access dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)).
> 3. It is my first time exploring into EDA, hence I will constantly improve on this project the further I go into the whole course (as I am currently undergoing the Applied Data Science course until February 2022 under the same Coding School).

I analysed the dataset provided, in which in contains over 100,000 orders from various marketplaces in Brazil, between the year of 2016 to 2018. I decided to then look into each of the states within the country, specifically on their preference of payment, the purchasing and selling power of each state, and how they correlate with the demographic of each of the states.

From there, I made a conclusion on how the data analysis can be leveraged upon in the example of application down below.

## Application
After doing the analysis on the data, it can be concluded that the data can be used to explore into:

1. Introducing new form of payment method to the population
2. Improve targeting on customers for advertising
3. Still, there are more works required to improve on the existing project, as well as more implementations needed to make the data more usable in the future - of which some will be discussed in the "Future Works" section.

## Future Works
In order to further improve the accuracy and performance of the data, as well as to better utilize the data, these are some of the methodologies that can be considered to be implemented:

1. Adding values to the NULL data
2. Running ML algorithm to replace the NULL data
3. Identifying and analyizing the similarities and differences of all the data sets
4. More demographic information of the customer, eg. Race, Gender, Age
